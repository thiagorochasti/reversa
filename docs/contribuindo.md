# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you found a bug, have an idea for a new agent, or want to improve something, the process is simple.

## Before submitting a PR

Open an issue first to discuss what you want to change. This avoids wasted work on both sides, especially for larger changes.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thiagorochasti/reversa.git

├── bin/                ← CLI entry point (reversa.js)

## Adding a new agent

1. Create the folder `agents/reversa-[name]/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` following the format of existing agents (required frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`)
3. Add a `references/` folder if the agent needs schema or reference templates
4. Update `lib/installer/` to include the new agent in the install list
