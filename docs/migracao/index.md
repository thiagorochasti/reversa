# Migration Team

The Migration Team is the next step after the Discovery Team. While Discovery produces specs of the legacy system, Migration transforms those specs into a rebuild plan for a modern stack.

---

## Prerequisite

You must have run `/reversa` first and have `_reversa_sdd/` populated with legacy specs. Without that, `/reversa-migrate` aborts with a clear message.

---

## How to run

```
/reversa-migrate
```

The first execution conducts an interview (objective, success metrics, constraints, target stack) and generates `_reversa_sdd/migration/migration_brief.md`. Subsequent runs reuse the brief.

---

## What happens

```
Brief (interview)
   │
   ▼
[1] Paradigm Advisor    → detects legacy paradigm, flags gap, forces conscious decision
   │
   ▼
[2] Curator             → decides what migrates, what gets discarded, case by case
   │
   ▼
[3] Strategist          → proposes strategies (Strangler, Big Bang, Parallel Run, Branch by Abstraction)
   │
   ▼
[4] Designer            → drafts target architecture, domain model, data plan
   │
   ▼
[5] Inspector           → defines proofs of behavioral equivalence
   │
   ▼
handoff.md              → input for the coding agent
```

Between agents there is a **human decision pause**. Default mode is interactive. Use `--auto` to skip pauses (not recommended in production).

---

## Where artifacts land

The Migration Team never touches legacy code or Discovery Team artifacts. Every `/reversa-migrate` output lands in `_reversa_sdd/migration/`, a subfolder inside the original specs.

## Next steps

- [The 5 agents](agentes.md): what each one does, inputs and outputs.
- [Paradigm shift](paradigma.md): why paradigm matters and how the Paradigm Advisor handles it.
- [Migration strategies](estrategias.md): catalog of the 4 strategies.
- [Brief schema](brief.md): questions and format of `migration_brief.md`.
